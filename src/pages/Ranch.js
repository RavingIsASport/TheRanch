          Ranch, Las Mariposas. It all started with a dream, my mother's dream.
          It was to have a ranch, not just any ranch but one with all types of
          animals, filled with lots of trees and fruits, and most importantly
          roses. She loved roses and all the bright colors they provided, red
          was her favorite. For some reason, they encountered many obstacles
          that pushed that dream further away. As I got older, I grew a love for
          all animals: horses, dogs, cats, you name it. When I was about 10
          years old my father's friend's cat had kittens and I begged him for
          one. When he finally agreed to let me have a kitten there was one
          condition. I name him Remigio. The name was awful but I wanted a
          kitten, so I accepted the terms. Remigio was my first pet. As the
          years passed my mother kept nurturing that love for animals. She
          raised rabbits and learned the hard way that you never place two male
          rabbits with a female. I remember this moment when the two males were
          fighting and my mother tried to separate them. All we could hear was
          my mother screaming for my dad's help. She was battling both rabbits
          with a broomstick. I'm sure y’all could imagine where the two rabbits
          ended up, inside my mother's pot. It was scary but after all the
          commotion we eventually all laughed about it. When I was about 12
          years old we moved to Texas. That’s where it all started. I had no
          idea that Texas was the place I would call home. I have everything
          here, my 4 beautiful children. They are the reason why fought for what
          I always dreamed of. Everything I have now didn’t come so easily. Not
          even this ranch. This ranch that I call home is only a piece of land
          in Rice, Texas. But this isn't just my home, it’s my dream come true.
          Not only my dream but my parent's. Every time I look at everything my
          husband and I have accomplished, I look back to the past with sadness.
          My parents passed too soon and unexpectedly and are not here to enjoy
          everything they dreamed of, but now I take a look at the present
          because I know they are proud of everything I have accomplished.
